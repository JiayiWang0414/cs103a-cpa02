a: what my app does and how it works:
My app is basically a course finder which enables unique comment feature.
Once a user sign up/login:

They can search a course using the search features(I attached the screenshot in the google drive and share it with anyone in Brandeis university group)

 They can also add courses to the schedule. Once they click on "add to schedule" button, there will be a form: a user can leave comment, rate the course and whether they recommend this course

 Once they click on the submit button in the form above, any user can see their coment history by clicking the "Comments" button in the navigation bar.

 Any user can repeat this process as many times as they want.
